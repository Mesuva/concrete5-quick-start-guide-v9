## Adding Images
Images can be added in two ways:

* By using an Image block.
* By editing a Content block and placing an image directly within the content.

## Adding YouTube videos

Paste in the address of the video from youtube (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEF) into the YouTube URl field and press 'Add'.
