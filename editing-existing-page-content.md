# 3. Editing existing page content

Most content on a concrete5 website is managed through adding and editing *blocks*. Blocks are displayed within *Editable Areas* on pages.

## To edit a block on a page

1. Select the **Edit Page (Pencil)** button on the top toolbar. 
2. Hover over the block you wish to edit. Editable blocks will be outlined in green (or blue if they have been placed in 'global' areas).
3. Click or tap on the block and from the context menu select **Edit Block**. Different block types have different editing controls. For general text content a *Content Block* is most often used. When Content blocks are edited the page content will become directly editable and a formatting toolbar will be presented above the content.

4. Edit the block contents using the controls displayed and save the block by selecting the blue **Save** button.

While the page is in Edit Mode further blocks on the page can be edited and saved.

## To add a new block to a page
1. Select the **Add Content (Plus)** button on the top toolbar. A block toolbar will slide in from the left.
2. **Drag** the block you wish to add onto the page, dropping it onto the green and blue highlighted areas.
3. The added block's edit controls will appear. Configure the block as you need and select the block's blue **Save** button.

### Editable areas
Areas that highlight in green are regular areas that appear on the current page only.
Areas that highlight in blue are 'Global' areas - content in these areas will appear sitewide

#To re-arrange blocks on a page

Blocks can be re-arranged on a page via the following steps:

1. Hover over the block you wish to move and start dragging it by the *four pointed arrow* in the top right corner of the block.

2. Drag the block to a new position - areas on the page will highlight to show possible new positions.
3. Let go of the mouse button while one of the new positions is highlighted.

## Publishing changes
While a page is in edit mode, only you can view the changes you have made. To make your pages visible to others click the green **Exit Edit Mode (Pencil)** button on the top left of the toolbar. The left sidebar will present save options.

Select the blue **Publish Changes** button to save the current version of the page. This will make your changes publically viewable.

At this point you can also:

**Save Changes** - this saves the changes made to the page, but doesn't approve the new changes for public viewing.

When you next visit the page while logged in you will see a 'Page is Pending' message. The new version of page will only be made public once the 'Approve Version' button is pressed.

**Discard Changes** - this will undo all edits made to the page and revert it to the state before the page was put into edit mode.
