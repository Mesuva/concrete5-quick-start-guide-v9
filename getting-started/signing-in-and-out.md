# Signing In and Out

To make changes to your site you will need to first sign in via the login page. This can be found by adding /index.php/login to the end of your site's address, e.g. _www.yoursite.com/index.php/login_

Enter your administrator _Username_ \(or email if prompted\) and _Password_ and press the **Sign In** button.

Signing in will return you to your site's home page, with a new tool bar across the top of the page.

## What browsers can I use to edit my site? <a id="browsers"></a>

concrete5 is designed to work with _modern_ browsers, such as _Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer 10+ and Microsoft Edge_. It is recommended you use a recently released browser to avoid editing issues. Basic editing tasks are possible on a tablet device, but it is recommended that you use a non-touch device for full editing control.

## Signing Out <a id="signout"></a>

Once you have completed your editing tasks it is good practice to sign out of your website.

To sign out select the **Dashboard \(Sliders\)** button on the top right of the toolbar and select the **Sign Out** link at the bottom of the panel.
