#6. Changing page names, URL paths and metadata

## To change the name or the url of a page
1. Select the **Page Settings (Gear)** button on the top toolbar. 
2. Select the **SEO** option.
3. Adjust the *Name* to adjust the page name - this is what appears on navigations and pages lists.
4. The *URL Slug* can be changed to adjust the address/url of the page.
5. The *Meta Title* and *Meta Description* values can also be changed.
5. Select **Save Changes**.
6. Select the **Edit Page (Pencil)** button on the top toolbar.
7. Finally, select the blue **Publish Changes** button.

Note - the Page Name and URL Slug fields are also available under the *Composer* panel. If this is available for the page you are editing you can use the fields there as well to make the same changes. 

### What are the 'Meta Title' and 'Meta Descriptions' used for?
A page's metadata is information about a page that isn't displayed directly on the page, but can be automatically read by search engines. Use these fields to specify the title and description of a page that appears within a search engine result. Often these changes are performed as part of *Search Engine Optimization*, or SEO.
