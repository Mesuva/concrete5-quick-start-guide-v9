# Signing In and Out

To make changes to your site you will need to first sign in via the login page. This can be found by adding /index.php/login to the end of your site's address, e.g. *www.yoursite.com/index.php/login*

Enter your administrator *Username* (or email if prompted) and *Password* and press the **Sign In** button.

Signing in will return you to your site's home page, with a new tool bar across the top of the page.

Q> ## What browsers can I use to edit my site?
Q>
Q> concrete5 is designed to work with *modern* browsers, such as *Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari,  Internet Explorer 10+ and Microsoft Edge*. It is recommended you use a recently released browser to avoid editing issues. Basic editing tasks are possible on a tablet device, but it is recommended that you use a non-touch device for full editing control.

### Signing Out

Once you have completed your editing tasks it is good practice to sign out of your website.

To sign out select the **Dashboard (Sliders)** button on the top right of the toolbar and select the **Sign Out** link at the bottom of the panel.
