# The Toolbar Explained

Most editing activities performed on a concrete5 website start via one of the top toolbar buttons - displayed after logging in.

Buttons on the *left* relate to the current page:

{icon=pencil}
G> ### Edit Mode (Pencil)
G>
G> Enables editing on the current page. The button will turn green when in editing mode.

{icon=cog}
G> ### Composer / Page Settings (Gear)
G> 
G> Opens a panel where settings for the current page can be configured, such as the page's layout, its name, metadata and 'attributes'.
G> If the page you are on is able to be edited via a 'Composer' form, this button will allow direct access to this form.

{icon=plus}
G> ### Add Content (Plus)
G>
G> Opens a side panel where the available 'block' types are listed for adding to the page. When this panel appears, blocks can be *dragged* from it onto the editable areas on the page.

The search and buttons on the *right* relate to site-wide activities: 

{icon=files-o}
G> ### Pages
G>
G> Opens a side panel listing the types of new pages that can be added. The panel also displays a sitemap, which can be used to quickly navigate to a page. Pages on the sitemap can also be dragged and dropped to re-order and change their nesting.

{icon=sliders}
G> ### Dashboard (Sliders)
G>
G> Displays the main pages of concrete5's 'Dashboard'. The Dashboard is where sitewide settings and functionality are available, such as managing files and users.

{icon=search}
G> ### Intelligent Search
G>
G> This search box can be used to quickly find; pages on your site, administration pages within the site's 'Dashboard' and help resources.
