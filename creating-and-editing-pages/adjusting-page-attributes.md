# Adjusting Page Attributes

## To hide a page from navigation

1. Select the **Page Settings (Gear)** button on the top toolbar.&#x20;
2. Select **Attributes**.
3. Within the sidebar, scroll down to find 'Exclude from Nav'.&#x20;
4. Click on the option so that it is highlighted with a blue background (if it is not already).
5.  On the right hand side, find the 'Exclude From Nav' attribute and check its checkbox.

6. Select **Save Changes**.
7. Select the **Edit Page (Pencil)** button on the top toolbar.
8. Finally, select the blue **Publish Changes** button.

Hiding a page from navigation does not prevent the page from being accessed, it simply stops a link to it from being shown on automatic navigation. You can still create links to the page manually.

### Other useful attributes

The attributes panel offers other built-in attributes that are useful for controlling your pages:

* Description
* Exclude From Page List
* Exclude From Sitemap
