# The Toolbar Explained

Most editing activities performed on a concrete5 website start via one of the top toolbar buttons.

**Buttons on the** _**left**_ **of the toolbar relate to the current page:**

## Edit Mode \(Pencil\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/pencil.png) Enables editing on the current page. The button will turn green when in editing mode.

## Composer / Page Settings \(Gear\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/cog.png) Opens a panel where settings for the current page can be configured, such as the page's layout, its name, metadata and 'attributes'. If the page you are on is able to be edited via a 'Composer' form, this button will allow direct access to this form.

## Add Content \(Plus\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/plus.png) Opens a side panel where the available 'block' types are listed for adding to the page. When this panel appears, blocks can be _dragged_ from it onto the editable areas on the page.

**The search and buttons on the** _**right**_ **relate to site-wide activities:**

## Pages

![](../.gitbook/assets/pages.png) Opens a side panel listing the types of new pages that can be added. The panel also displays a sitemap, to quickly navigate to a page. Pages on the sitemap can also be dragged to re-order and change their nesting.

## Dashboard \(Sliders\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/slider.png) Displays the main pages of concrete5's 'Dashboard'. The Dashboard is where site-wide settings and functionality are available, such as managing files and users.

## Intelligent Search

![](../.gitbook/assets/search.png) This search box can be used to quickly find; pages on your site, administration pages within the site's 'Dashboard' and help resources.
