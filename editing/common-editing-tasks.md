## To insert links to pages, files and external URLs

Within a Content block, _highlight some text_ and select the **Link** button on the Content block toolbar.

From the dialog, you can either:

* Select the sitemap button, to select a page within your site. 
* Select the file button, to select a file to link to from the file manager.
* Directly enter the URL that you wish to link to \(in particular for external websites\).

## Adding Images

Images can be added in two ways:

* By adding an **Image** block.
* By using a **Content** block and placing an image directly within the content.

## Adding YouTube videos

Add a **YouTube Video** block to embed a youtube video. Paste in the address of the video from youtube \(e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEF)\) into the YouTube URL field and press 'Add'.

## To copy blocks to the clipboard

Blocks can be copied to a 'clipboard' within concrete5, allowing them to be easily copied between pages. To copy a block:
